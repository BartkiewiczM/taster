        until you have a smooth, lump-free batter.\r\nAt this point, mix in the butter
        or the vegetable oil. Alternatively, you can use them to grease the pan before
        frying each pancake.\r\nHeat a non-stick pan over medium heat, then pour in
        the batter, swirling the pan to help it spread.\r\nWhen the pancake starts
        pulling away a bit from the sides, and the top is no longer wet, flip it and
        cook shortly on the other side as well.\r\nTransfer to a plate. Cook the remaining
        batter until all used up.\r\nServe warm, with the filling of your choice.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/58bkyo1593350017.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EZS4ev2crHc","strIngredient1":"Flour","strIngredient2":"Eggs","strIngredient3":"Milk","strIngredient4":"Water","strIngredient5":"Salt","strIngredient6":"Sugar","strIngredient7":"Butter","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"1
