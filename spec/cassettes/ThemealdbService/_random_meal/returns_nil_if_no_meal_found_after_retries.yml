        the side of the sink \u2013 they should be closed or should slowly close when
        tapped \u2013 if they stay open, throw them away. If any of the shells still
        have barnacles or stringy beards attached, pull them off with a cutlery knife
        and rinse the shells well. Keep in the colander, covered with a cold, damp
        cloth, until you\u2019re ready to cook. Peel the prawn shells on the body
        section only \u2013 leave the heads and tails intact. Score down the backs
        and pull out any gritty entrails. Chill until you\u2019re ready to cook.\r\nPut
        the saffron in a small cup, cover with 50ml kettle-hot water and set aside
        for 10 mins. If using vermicelli, put in a bowl and crush to little pieces
        (about 1cm long) with your hands.\r\nHeat the oil in a large frying pan with
        at least a 3cm lip, or a 40cm paella pan. Add the onion and stir around the

        in the vermicelli and cook for 5 mins, stirring from time to time, until the
        vermicelli is toasted brown. Stir in the paprika.\r\nKeeping the heat moderate,
        stir through the monkfish, squid and saffron with its water, seasoning well.
        Spread the ingredients out in an even layer, then pour over the hot stock
        and scatter the tomatoes on top. Bring to a simmer, then cover the whole dish
        with a tight-fitting lid (or foil). Turn the heat to medium and cook for 6
        mins.\r\nUncover and stir to incorporate the dry top layer of pasta. Push
        the mussels into the pasta so the hinges are buried in the bottom of the dish,
        and they stand straight up. Arrange the prawns on top, cover tightly and cook
        for another 6 mins or until the mussels are open, the prawns are pink and
        the pasta is cooked through. Leave to simmer for another 2-3 mins to cook
        off most of the remaining liquid (leave a little in the pan to prevent the
        pasta from sticking together). Allow to sit for 2-3 mins, then squeeze over
        the lemon juice and arrange the wedges on top. Scatter with parsley before

        Spread with a thin layer of cheese filling, then cover with a courgette omelette.
        Repeat, alternating the layers, until all the omelettes and filling are in
        the tin, finishing with an omelette. Flip the cling film over the omelette,
        then chill for up to 24 hrs.\r\nTo serve, invert the omelette cake onto a
        serving plate and peel off the cling film. Pile rocket on the top and scatter

        the mushrooms into a food processor with some seasoning and pulse to a rough
        paste. Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about 10
        mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms. Spread
        out on a plate to cool.\r\nHeat in a frying pan and add a little olive oil.
        Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side. (You
        don''t want to cook it at this stage, just colour it). Remove the beef from
        the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard.\r\nLay a
        sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on
        it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom
        paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping
        a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and
        mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of
        the cling film to secure. Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and
        keep its shape.\r\nRoll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large
        rectangle, the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Remove the cling film from the
        beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk.
        Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess.
        Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over
        all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest.\r\nHeat
        the oven to 200C, 400F, gas 6.\r\nLightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals
        and glaze again with beaten egg yolk. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the
        oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas 4 and cook for another 15 mins. Allow to rest
        for 10-15 mins before slicing and serving with the side dishes of your choice.
        The beef should still be pink in the centre when you serve it.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/vvpprx1487325699.jpg","strTags":"Meat,Stew","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FS8u1RBdf6I","strIngredient1":"mushrooms","strIngredient2":"English
